Quick creation of sites driven by Twitter search results, using `Node.js`_ and
`Redis`_.

.. _`Node.js`: http://nodejs.org/
.. _`Redis`: http://redis.io

Usage
=====

#. Clone the repo.

#. ``npm install`` to install dependencies.

#. Edit `settings.js`_.

   * If you want to use the `Streaming APIs`_, you'll need to register an app at
     https://dev.twitter.com/ and use its consumer key and secret. Streaming is
     associated with the account you authenticate with - you can generate an
     access token for your own Twitter acount for local development.

   * If Twitter credentials are not supplied, the site poller will fall back to
     calling the `Search API`_ every ``pollInterval`` seconds.

   * Express requires that you put *something* in ``sessionSecret`` to hash its
     sessions with.

#. Start ``redis-server``.

#. ``node server.js`` to start polling for Tweets and serve up a site which uses
   the Tweets.

#. Hack.
