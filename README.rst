Quick creation of sites driven by polling a Twitter search, using `Node.js`_
and `Redis`_.

.. _`Node.js`: http://nodejs.org/
.. _`Redis`: http://redis.io

Usage
=====

#. Clone the repo.

#. ``npm install`` to install dependencies.

#. Edit `settings.js`_.

   If you have keys for a Twitter app you want to use, plug 'em in, but the
   Twitter `Search API`_ doesn't require authentication.

   Add the search text you want to use to the search setting.

#. Start ``redis-server``.

#. ``node server.js`` to start polling for Tweets and serve up a site which uses
   the Tweets.

#. Hack.
